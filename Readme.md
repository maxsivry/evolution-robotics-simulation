Welcome to my evolutionary robotics simulation! 

For anyone curious, I have been following along a youtube lecture series by Josh Bongard and the accompanying instructions found at https://www.reddit.com/r/ludobots/ to simulate robots and give movement tasks to learn via RF.

Check out the branches to look at the most recent code, will update main when I am mroe satisfied with the project.
